# Modified React-ID-Swiper

This project is a modified version of the original [react-id-swiper](https://github.com/kidjp85/react-id-swiper) library created by [kidjp85](https://github.com/kidjp85). The purpose of this modification is to replace the usage of React with the `@wordpress/element` package, which is a part of the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg) ecosystem.
